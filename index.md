# Heta language

**Heta language** is a domain specific programming language for dynamic quantitative models used in quantitative systems pharmacology and systems biology.

The key idea of Heta language is the development and editing the biological models as expressive programming code which gives us the benefits of programming languages like: compact and human readable format, modularity, code reuse etc. as well as using modern technologies such as version control or DevOps. The heta code can be exported to different formats or imbedded in modeling software.

## Origin
Heta language was originally been developed for internal projects of InSysBio LLC to support development of large-scale QSP modeling platforms and storing them in database-like formats.
